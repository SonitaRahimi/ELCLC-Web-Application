<H2>Mission Statements</H2>
<SECTION ID="FIRST">At <B>ELCLCs</B>,our mission is to enhance <B>English Language and Computer</B> skills in seven Afghan 
Universities by providing instruction in English Language through Computer Assisted Language Learning,
office automation and Internet skills so that Afghan Universities’ faculties and students could keep
up the global standards.
</SECTION>
<H2>Introduction</H2>
<SECTION ID="SECOND"><B>English Language and Computer Learning Centers (ELCLCs)</B> is a U.S. Embassy funded project, 
which is being implemented by Educational Support Organization <B><I>(ESO)</B></I>, a non-profitable Afghan local NGO.
ELCLCs operate in seven Afghan universities namely Kabul University, Kabul Polytechnic University, 
Balkh University, Herat University, Kandahar University, Nangarhar University and Sheikh Zayed University (Khost).
The ELCLCs project is the successor to the Afghan eLearning English Support Project (AeLESP), 
funded by the U.S Embassy until Jan 31st, 2011, which itself was the successor of the Afghan 
e-Quality Alliances (AeQA), funded by <B><I>USAID </B></I>until Dec 31st, 2010. 
Herat University ELCLC was established in 2008 by AeQA project and so far has managed to train
over 4000 Students, Faculty and University staff in English and ICDL.
An even more serious problem is encountered during long-distance, satellitebased
communications due to the time lags.<br><br> To transmit a signal, it must go up to
the satellite and then back down t0 milliseconds to go up to the satellite and
back down again. This time, together with the processing delays on the ground and
in the satellite, add up to about a 2o the earth. A geostationary satellite is at a height
of approximately 100,000 km above the earth – a quarter of the distance to the
moon. Radio waves will take about 70 second lag. There is thus a 4 second gap between
one participant doing or saying something and when the effects of that upon the
other participant become evident.

<H2>What ELCLCs Offer?</H2>
<SECTION ID="sec_one">In order for students, faculty members and lecturers of Afghan universities to keep up with the 
global standards, basic knowledge of English language and <B><I>IT</B></I> are essential.ELCLCs’ main courses are
designed include English as a Foreign Language <B><I>(EFL)</B></I>, Information and Communication Technology <B><I>(ICT)</B></I>, 
and English for Specific Purposes <B><I>(ESP)</B></I> for students and lecturers of different departments.
The courses in ELCLCs are taught by qualified Afghan instructors with research-proven methodologies,
equipped computer labs, high-speed wireless Internet access, up-to-date Computer 
Assisted Language Learning (CALL) technologies and comprehensive course curricula developed by 
Washington State University.ELCLCs are an important resource for students, including many females, 
who want to learn English and computer skills to enhance their academic skills.

<H2>Key Features of ELCLCs services (CALL)</H2>
<SECTION ID="sec_two">Key Features of ELCLCs services is the acquisition of knowledge and teaching a 
second language through utilization of numerous Information and Communications Technology (ICT)
approaches and applications.An even more serious problem is encountered during long-distance, satellitebased
communications due to the time lags. To transmit a signal, it must go up to
the satellite and then back down to the earth. A geostationary satellite is at a height
of approximately 100,000 km above the earth – a quarter of the distance to the
moon. <br><br>Radio waves will take about 700 milliseconds to go up to the satellite and
back down again. This time, together with the processing delays on the ground and
in the satellite, add up to about a 2 second lag. There is thus a 4 second gap between
one participant doing or saying something and when the effects of that upon the
other participant become evident. ELCLC is the first ever project in Afghanistan that is fully equipped
with appropriate CALL technologies. CALL provides various distinctive benefits to the students and
helps them learn faster and more effectively.

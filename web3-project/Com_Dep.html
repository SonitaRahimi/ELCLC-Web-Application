<H2>ICDL</H2>
<SECTION ID="s_1">
ICDL is a test of practical skills and competencies, which consists of eleven modules covering 
computer theory and practice. To achieve an ECDL/ICDL certification, the candidate must successfully 
pass the tests in all seven modules.The ELCLCs at seven public universities not only offer training 
in ICDL but are also ICDL ap-proved test centers where students can take the ICDL test and achieve 
the internationally recognized ICDL certificate.<br><br>
An even more serious problem is encountered during long-distance, satellitebased
communications due to the time lags. To transmit a signal, it must go up to
the satellite and then back down to the earth. A geostationary satellite is at a height
of approximately 100,000 km above the earth – a quarter of the distance to the
moon. Radio waves will take about 700 milliseconds to go up to the satellite and
back down again. This time, together with the processing delays on the ground and
in the satellite, add up to about a 2 second lag. There is thus a 4 second gap between
one participant doing or saying something and when the effects of that upon the
other participant become evident.</br><br>

<h2>ELearning</h2>
<section id="s_2">
In addition to the aforementioned services, our centers use eLearning to enhance the train-ing 
quality. ELearning is a new educational concept which involves the use of computers or other 
electronic devices and the Internet technology which provides a learner-oriented envi-ronment 
for the teachers and students.<br></br>
